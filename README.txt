Selection of utilties built during my time at Pillsbury Law.

attach2email
	- Some development and testing require producing a large variety of OFT files. These can be time consuming to produce, en masse. This simplifies the process considerably.

backBackup
	- Users were having trouble losing Office files, even with AutoRecovery turned on. 
	- asdGrabber can be made a scheduled task
	- adsPutterBacker [sic] can be called when a recovery file can't be accessed, or to preview what's in them.

BinaryCopy
	- We experienced some problems where users found that a number of Word files from our DMS were coming up as protected files. Rather than individually allowing editing, we did a binary copy of entire directories at a time to get around the alternative data stream.
	
ChangeGear
	- ChangeGear didn't provide a convenient way to edit the subject lines filtered out as they came into the ticketing system or to review what was being filtered. During testing, some of our in-house autoreply phrases started a loop in the system. This utility allows a user to add a phrase with a simple textbox input.
	
CP_Reg_RC
	- Allows a user to change the default value of a subkey.
	
eastAsiaFix
	- We had a problem generated by an illegal value in the eastAsia attribute of our Normal template. 
	- This changes it to a legal value. Allows firm to fix the problem without replacing template and losing individual customizations/macros
	
LastAccess
	- Need to clear out unused/forgotten templates
	- Used to test whether or not we could learn which templates users currently rely on.
	
	- Suggested enhancements
		- needs config file

Lazarus
	- Some users ignore all prompts to save their work before a forced reboot (security updates). Lazarus can be called before and after reboot to save all the Office files currently open, then open them again after reboot. This avoids lost work, ensures that things are saved to the DMS when appropriate.
		
listReplicated
	- Need to check that all the network templates are properly replicated to user's computer
	- Creates a comparison of the two directories
	
	- Suggested enhancements
		- needs config file

templateDeploy
	- Frequent need to update firmwide templates
	- Replicated files are kept in a single location
	- Edited files are kept in a separate location
		- copy edited files
		- attach edited files to an email
		- send email to those who need to implement replication
